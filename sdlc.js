// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

"planning, analysis of rerquirement, design, testing & integrataion, implementaion, maintain"

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirement = "This is the second step, in which the the goal is to gather all the specific details required for a new system."
const design = "this is the third step, in which the design should include diagrams, sketches, and schemas. once the design is finalized, it cannot be changed later."
const testingAndIntegration = "this is the fourth step, once the development is finished it is now time to test the software for bugs. this ensures that the end-user experience is not comprimised in any way."
const implementaion = "this is the fifth step, once the testing of the custom software is over, the implementation will start. the developers will integrate different modules or designs into the primary code."
const maintain = "this is the final step, to function properly, the software will require regular updates and maintenance."
